The npm postinstall hook provides no good way to differentiate a developer who
runs `npm install` to develop the `embedded-host-node` package, versus a user
who runs `npm install` to get `embedded-host-node` from npm.

This file simply exists to distinguish the two environments. When
`embedded-host-node` is published to npm, this file is not contained within the
distributed tarball.

See: `./install.js`
